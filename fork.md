## What is Fork?

A server-side copy of someone else's repository on your GitHub account. It creates a completely independent copy that you control.

## Key Points

- Lives on GitHub servers, not your computer
- You own and control the forked copy
- Can't directly push/pull to original repo
- Used for contributing to projects you don't own
- Standard workflow for open-source contributions

## When to Use

- Contributing to projects without write access
- Experimenting with changes safely
- Creating your own version of existing code

## Under the Hood

When you fork:
1. GitHub creates complete copy on their servers
2. New repo linked to your account
3. Maintains connection to original for pull requests
4. You still need to clone it to work locally
