## What is Pull Request?

A proposal to merge code from one branch to another. It's a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket feature, NOT a Git command.

**Note:** Despite the name, it's NOT related to `git pull` command.

## Key Points

- Enables code review before merging
- Shows all code differences in web interface
- Team members can comment on specific lines
- Tracks discussion, approvals, and tests
- Used between branches or from fork to original repo

## Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "message"`
3. Push to remote: `git push origin feature-name`
4. Open PR on GitHub/GitLab (web interface)
5. Team reviews and discusses
6. Address feedback with more commits
7. Merge after approval
